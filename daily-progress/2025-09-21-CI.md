Continuous Integration (CI) in DevOps



Continuous Integration (CI) is a DevOps practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository, often multiple times a day. Each merge automatically triggers a build and test process using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD.



ðŸ”¹ Why CI?



Detects bugs early



Ensures code quality



Speeds up development



Reduces integration issues



ðŸ”¹ Key Tools:



Jenkins â€“ Open-source automation server



GitHub Actions â€“ CI/CD directly inside GitHub



GitLab CI/CD â€“ Built-in with GitLab repos



CircleCI, Travis CI â€“ Popular cloud-based CI services



In simple terms: CI makes sure that every new code commit is automatically tested and validated, so teams can deliver software faster, safer, and with fewer bugs.
