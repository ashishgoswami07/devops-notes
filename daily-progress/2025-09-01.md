DevOps Notes
Overview
Starting Point (Challenges)

Deployment delays

High operational cost

Communication issues

Problems with security

High failure rate

Delayed code execution

No plan for implementation

Continuous integration issues

Definition of DevOps

DevOps is a way of working that allows for continuous delivery.

Encourages collaboration

Enables automation

Instills a "continuous" culture

Requires a paradigm shift

DevOps = Development + Operations + Testing

Why DevOps Matters

Development + Operations = Unified Infrastructure

Maximizes productivity

Simplifies the software production lifecycle

Makes each phase programmable & dynamic

Improves release & deployment frequency

Maximizes predictability, efficiency & security

Aids in release management

Helps find bugs early

DevOps Life Cycle

Rapid release, multiphased Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with a strong feedback loop

Test-driven to ensure robust software

Uses code that is continuously:

Built

Tested

Released

Monitored

Phases

Development Side:

Plan

Code

Build

Test

Operations Side:

Release

Deploy

Operate

Monitor

CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery)

Continuous Integration (CI): Developers integrate code frequently, exposing issues/bugs early.

Continuous Delivery (CD): Practices & tools to deliver quickly. After QA testing, software is ready for production.

Flow
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor

Continuous Paradigm

Continuity at every stage of the SDLC

Continuous Development

Continuous Testing

Continuous Integration

Continuous Deployment

Continuous Monitoring

Benefits of DevOps

Curated culture, connected teams, efficient workers

Engaged employees, great collaboration

Economic opportunities

Tighter tech, improved quality, more simplicity

Quick problem solving, greater stability

Continuous delivery

Business Benefits

Lower IT costs

Quick delivery

Increased flexibility

High innovation

DevOps in Cloud
Tools

Suite of managed cloud-based tools forming pipelines

Code & bug tracking

Automated unit testing & development

Reviewing & monitoring

Why Cloud DevOps?

Saves time & energy

Collapses into a single silo for collaboration

Automates deployment process

Lowers cost in development, testing, deployment & operations

Example: Oracle Cloud (OCI DevOps as a Service)

CI/CD platform for automating SDLC

Store code privately & access external code

Build, test, deploy using pipelines

Complete CI/CD automation

Organize deployments

DevOps as a Service (Benefits)

Automation → Scalability

Integration & Interoperability

Low risk of deployment

Lower cost

Cloud Native Solutions
Step 1: Migrating static web to OCI compute instance

Load balancer → advanced network traffic management

IAM policies → Identity & Access Management

OCI Microservices

API Gateway

WAF (Web Application Firewall) → protection from common attacks

DevOps Services → Automation & collaboration

Artifact Registry

Container Registry

Service Mesh → Communication between microservices

Container Engine for Kubernetes

Containers

Autonomous Database

Functions

Resource Manager → Infrastructure creation with code & templates

Few Word-Meanings

Robust = Error handling

Orchestrate = Organize something
