# DevOps Notes

These are my DevOps handwritten notes converted into Markdown format for GitHub.

## 1. Overview
**Challenges**
- Deployment delays  
- High operational cost  
- Communication issues  
- Security problems  
- High failure rate  
- Delayed code execution  
- No plan for implementation  
- CI issues  

**Definition**
DevOps = Development + Operations + Testing  
- Encourages collaboration  
- Enables automation  
- Builds a “continuous” culture  

---

## 2. Why DevOps Matters
- Unifies Development & Operations  
- Maximizes productivity  
- Simplifies SDLC  
- Improves release frequency  
- Helps find bugs early  

---

## 3. DevOps Life Cycle
- Rapid release with feedback loop  
- Test-driven & robust software  
- Continuous build → test → release → monitor  

**Phases**
- **Development:** Plan, Code, Build, Test  
- **Operations:** Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor  

---

## 4. CI/CD
**Continuous Integration (CI):**
- Frequent code integration  
- Detect bugs early  

**Continuous Delivery (CD):**
- Automates release pipeline  
- Ready for production after QA  

**Flow:**
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor  

---

## 5. Benefits of DevOps
- Connected teams & collaboration  
- Quick problem solving  
- Continuous delivery  

**Business Benefits**
- Lower IT cost  
- Faster delivery  
- More innovation  

---

## 6. DevOps in Cloud
**Tools**
- Code & bug tracking  
- Automated testing  
- Monitoring  

**Why Cloud DevOps?**
- Saves time & energy  
- Single collaboration silo  
- Automates deployment  
- Lowers cost  

**Example: OCI DevOps**
- Private code storage  
- Build, test, deploy pipelines  
- Full CI/CD automation  

---

## 7. DevOps as a Service
- Automation → Scalability  
- Integration & interoperability  
- Low deployment risk  
- Lower cost  

---

## 8. Cloud Native Solutions
- Migrate static web → compute instance  
- Use load balancer + IAM policies  

**OCI Microservices**
- API Gateway  
- WAF  
- DevOps services  
- Artifact & Container registry  
- Service mesh  
- Kubernetes engine  
- Autonomous DB  
- Resource Manager  

---

## 9. Key Concepts
- **Robust** = Error handling  
- **Orchestrate** = Organize something
